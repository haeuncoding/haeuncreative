### Hello! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nathan Kwon and I use he/him pronouns.

I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer who utilizes React, Redux, Rails, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, in addition to his experience with Photoshop and Procreate, to create aesthetically pleasing user interfaces. As I am also deeply involved with the arts, I'm incredibly passionate about creating products that give joy to people's days and inspire them to change and interact with the world around them. I recently worked on a MERN stack app, called exquis, that focuses on collaborative storytelling, where users take turns creating a story, sentence by sentence. 

Outside of coding, I enjoy painting and illustrating, as well as making music and reading, particularly authors like Ted Chiang, Italo Calvino, and Noam Chomsky.
